# Hello Node
Test commit to see the version increment in GitHub and DockerHub after the auto build from Jenkins pipeline

This is a very basic Hello World application written with Node.test

It includes a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with the application, and a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a build pipeline for it.
